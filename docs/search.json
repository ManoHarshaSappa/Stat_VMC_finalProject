    "text": "Visualization1: What are the trends in the frequency of car crashes over years?\n\nMethodology - To analyze the trend of crash frequency over the years, we will use ggplot2 in R. This allows us to create visual representations of data. We’ll transform the Crash_Date column into a date format and group the data by year. By visualizing this data, we can identify any noticeable patterns or trends in crash frequency over time.\n\n\n\nHypothesis 1: Can we determine the effectiveness of different traffic control measures in reducing collision rates? Which types of traffic controls are most effective in preventing collisions?\n\nMethodology - To address this hypothesis, we will conduct a Pearson’s Chi-squared test between traffic control measures and injury severity. By statistically analyzing data on traffic control measures and their impact on collision rates, we can assess the effectiveness of various measures and identify the most impactful ones for preventing collisions.\n\n\n\nPrediction 1: Can we predict the severity of injuries based on various factors such as weather conditions, road surface conditions, and collision type?\n\nMethodology - To make predictions about injury severity, we will utilize a random forest classification model trained on relevant dataset. This model will analyze various factors such as weather conditions, road surface conditions, and collision type to predict injury severity. By assessing the model’s accuracy and performance, we can determine its effectiveness in predicting injury severity.\n\n\n\nPrediction 2: Finding the location of Crashes using the K-means algorithm?\n\nMethodology - K-means is a method used to cluster data points into groups based on their similarity. Initially, it randomly selects points on a graph known as centroids, which represent the centers of the clusters. Then, each data point is assigned to the nearest centroid, forming an initial grouping. Afterward, the centroids are recalculated as the average position of all the points within each cluster. This process of assigning and updating centroids iterates until the centroids stabilize, meaning they don’t move much between iterations. At that point, the algorithm has identified the clusters, and each data point belongs to the group associated with the nearest centroid. Overall, k-means is a straightforward yet powerful technique for partitioning data into distinct groups based on their proximity to one another.\n\n\n\nVisualization2: How does the distribution of car accidents vary geographically?\n\nMethodology - To understand the geographical distribution of car accidents, we will utilize the Leaflet package in R. This package enables us to create interactive maps displaying crash locations and associated fatalities using latitude and longitude data. By visualizing this data on a map, we can identify any geographic patterns or hotspots where accidents are more prevalent.\n\n\n\nMore Research Questions\n\n\n### Visualization3: Top 10 cars which involve in car cashes?\n#**Methodology -** To identify the top 10 car manufacturers involved in car accidents, we will generate a bar plot using ggplot2 in R. This plot will showcase the most common vehicle makes involved in accidents. We'll use dplyr for data summarization and arrangement to identify the top 10 manufacturers based on accident frequency.\n\n### Hypothesis 2: Is there any relation between weather conditions, daylight, and injury severity?\n#**Methodology -** To test this hypothesis, we will conduct a Pearson's Chi-squared test on a contingency table. This test will analyze the association between weather conditions, daylight, and injury severity. By examining the relationship between these variables statistically, we can determine if there's a significant correlation between them.\n\n### Hypothesis 3: Are certain types of vehicles more likely to be involved in collisions at night compared to during the day?\n#**Methodology -** To investigate this hypothesis, we will perform a Pearson's Chi-squared test comparing collision counts involving different types of vehicles during the day and at night. By statistically analyzing collision data, we can determine if certain vehicle types are more prone to accidents during specific times of the day.\n\n### Hypothesis 4: Do drivers distracted by electronic devices have a higher rate of collisions compared to drivers distracted by other factors?\n#**Methodology -** To explore this hypothesis, we will conduct a Chi-squared test comparing collision counts between drivers distracted by electronic devices and those distracted by other factors. By examining collision data and analyzing distraction-related factors, we can determine if electronic device distraction significantly impacts collision rates.\n\n### Prediction #3: Can we predict the extent of vehicle damage in collisions based on collision type, vehicle movement, and speed limit?\n#**Methodology -** To make predictions about vehicle damage extent, we will evaluate model performance using confusion matrix and key predictors. By analyzing collision data and training a predictive model, we can assess its accuracy in predicting the extent of vehicle damage based on collision type, vehicle movement, and speed limit."

    "text": "Pre2: Finding the locations of crashes using the K-means algorithm?\n\nFirst, we import some tools we need, like ggplot2 for making graphs and dplyr for managing data. Next, We pick out the latitude and longitude data from our dataset. This helps us group locations based on where they are.\nWe adjust the data so it’s all on the same scale. This helps us compare things more easily. It’s like making sure all the ingredients for a recipe are measured in the same units.\nWe try out different numbers of clusters to see which one works best. Think of it like trying to find the best number of groups for organizing your things. We use a method called the “elbow method” to help us decide.\n\n\nGraph: Elbow Method - K means\n\n\nThe elbow method suggests that the optimal number of clusters is 2, it means that adding more clusters doesn’t significantly improve the clustering quality, and two clusters are sufficient to capture the main patterns in the data effectively.\n\n\n\nGraph :\n\n\nOnce we figure out that two clusters are best for our data, we use a method called K-Means to group similar points together. It’s like sorting marbles into different colored bags based on how close they are to each other.\nThen, we tag each point with the cluster it belongs to. This lets us study and show which accidents are in which group.\nLastly, we make a picture showing all the accident spots. Each spot is colored according to its cluster, so we can see how they’re grouped together on a map. It helps us see patterns in where accidents happen.\nThe two clusters represent two distinct geographical regions or patterns of accidents within the dataset. Red cluster might represent areas with high accident density, while the other cluster might represent areas with lower accident frequency.\n\n\n\nCode\n\n\n# Load required libraries\n#library(ggplot2)\n#library(dplyr)\n\n# Assuming your dataset is called 'location_data' and contains columns 'Latitude' and 'Longitude'\n\n# Select latitude and longitude columns\n#location_data &lt;- data %&gt;% select(Latitude, Longitude)\n\n# Normalize data\n#normalized_data &lt;- scale(location_data)\n\n# Initialize vector to store within-cluster sum of squares (WCSS)\n#wcss &lt;- vector()\n\n# Iterate over different values of k\n#for (i in 1:10) {\n  # Apply K-Means algorithm\n # kmeans_model &lt;- kmeans(normalized_data, centers = i)\n  \n  #Store within-cluster sum of squares (WCSS)\n#  wcss[i] &lt;- kmeans_model$tot.withinss}\n\n# Plot the elbow curve\n#plot4 = elbow_plot &lt;- ggplot(data = data.frame(k = 1:10, WCSS = wcss), aes(x = k, y = WCSS)) +\n  #geom_line(color = \"blue\") +\n  #geom_point(color = \"red\") +\n  #labs(title = \"Elbow Method for Optimal K\",\n   #    x = \"Number of Clusters (k)\",\n  #     y = \"Within-Cluster Sum of Squares (WCSS)\") +\n  #scale_x_continuous(breaks = 1:10)\n\n# plot4\n\n\n#library(stats)\n#library(ggplot2)\n\n# Numerical columns for clustering\n#numerical_cols &lt;- c(\"Latitude\", \"Longitude\")\n\n# Subset the data with only numerical columns\n#numerical_data &lt;- data[, numerical_cols]\n\n# Standardizing numerical data\n#scaled_data &lt;- scale(numerical_data)\n\n# Determine the optimal number of clusters based on the elbow method\n#num_clusters &lt;- 2\n\n# Perform k-means clustering with the chosen number of clusters\n#kmeans_model &lt;- kmeans(scaled_data, centers = num_clusters)\n\n# Add cluster labels to the original dataset\n#data$Cluster &lt;- as.factor(kmeans_model$cluster)\n\n# Visualize the clusters\n#plot5 = ggplot(data = data, aes(x = Longitude, y = Latitude, color = Cluster)) +\n  #geom_point() +\n  #labs(title = \"Clustering of Accidents based on Location\") +\n  #theme_minimal()\n\n#plot5"

They serve as predictor variables as they are used to specify the locations where circle markers will be placed on the map.\n\nExplanation of the Code: This utilizes the Leaflet package in R to generate an interactive map. It begins by loading Leaflet and then initializes a map object. Using latitude and longitude data from a dataframe named ‘data’, it places circle markers on the map to represent specific locations, like crash sites.

It is the variable of interest that we are analyzing and visualizing in the plot.\n#-   Vehicle.Make: This variable represents the make or manufacturer of the vehicles involved in accidents. It serves as the predictor variable in this analysis, as it is used to group the data and determine the count of accidents for each vehicle make.\n\n\n#**Explanation of the Code:** This generates a bar plot showing the top 10 most common vehicle makes involved in accidents, with vehicle make names on the y-axis and the number of accidents on the x-axis. It uses dplyr to summarize and arrange the data, then ggplot2 for visualization.\n\n\n## hypo#2. is there any relation between weather condition, day light on injury severity\n\n#This test performs provided performs a chi-square test to determine whether there is a statistically significant association between weather condition, light condition, on injury severity, Here's an explanation of why this test was conducted and what was observed:\n\n#1.  **Weather and Light**: This part of the analysis explores whether there's a relationship between weather conditions (e.g., clear, rainy, snowy) and light conditions (e.g., daylight, dark with street lights, dark without street lights). For instance, the test can indicate whether certain weather conditions are more likely to occur in conjunction with specific light conditions. A significant result suggests that weather and light conditions are not independent of each other.\n\n#**Chi-Square Test**: The chi-square test is a statistical test used to determine whether there is a significant association between two categorical variables. In this case, the variables of interest are weather condition, light condition.\n\n#**Observation**: By analyzing the contingency table generated from the data, which shows the frequency distribution of the combinations of weather condition, light condition, we can observe the following:\n\n#-   The contingency table provides counts of the number of accidents for each combination of weather condition, light condition.\n\n#-   The chi-square test is then applied to assess whether these variables are independent of each other or if there is a relationship between them.\n\n# Contingency table of Weather, Light, and Injury Severity\n#contingency_table &lt;- table(data$Weather, data$Light, data$Injury.Severity)\n\n# Remove any empty dimensions\n#contingency_table &lt;- margin.table(contingency_table, c(1, 2))\n\n\n# Chi-square test of independence\n#chi_square_test &lt;- chisq.test(contingency_table)\n\n# Print the test results\n#print(chi_square_test)\n\n#**Interpretation of Results**: To analyze this, a Pearson's Chi-squared test was conducted on the contingency table. The output indicates a significant relationship between these variables, with a very low p-value (p \\&lt; 2.2e-16). This suggests that the observed frequencies of injury severity across different weather conditions and daylight statuses are unlikely to have occurred by chance alone, indicating a strong association between these factors.\n\n\n## hypo#3. Are certain types of vehicles more likely to be involved in collisions at night compared to during the day?\n\n# The code aims to determine whether certain types of vehicles are more likely to be involved in collisions at night compared to during the day. Here's a clear interpretation of the analysis:\n\n# 1.  **Daylight Collisions**: This subset represents collisions that occurred during daylight hours.\n\n# 2.  **Nighttime Collisions with Lights On**: This subset represents collisions that occurred at night with lights on.\n\n# **Chi-Square Test**: A chi-square test of independence is performed to assess whether there is a significant association between vehicle types and the time of the collision (day or night).\n# Subset data for collisions during the day and at night\n#collisions_day &lt;- subset(data, Light == \"DAYLIGHT\")\n#collisions_night &lt;- subset(data, Light == \"DARK LIGHTS ON\")\n\n# Get the counts of each vehicle type for day and night collisions\n#counts_day &lt;- table(collisions_day$Vehicle.Body.Type)\n#counts_night &lt;- table(collisions_night$Vehicle.Body.Type)\n\n# Perform chi-square test of independence\n#chi_square_test &lt;- chisq.test(counts_day, counts_night)\n\n# Print the test results\n# print(chi_square_test)\n\n#**Interpretation of Results**: To analyze this, a Pearson's Chi-squared test was conducted comparing the counts of collisions involving different types of vehicles during the day and at night. The output indicates that there is no significant difference in the distribution of collisions across different types of vehicles between day and night, with a p-value of 0.2408. This suggests that the likelihood of different types of vehicles being involved in collisions is similar during both day and night.\n\n\n## hypo#4. Do drivers distracted by electronic devices have a higher rate of collisions compared to drivers distracted by other factors?\n\n#The analysis aims to determine whether drivers distracted by electronic devices have a higher rate of collisions compared to drivers distracted by other factors. Here's a clear interpretation of the results:\n\n#1.  **Driver.Distracted.By**: This variable indicates the factor(s) distracting the driver at the time of the collision. In this analysis, it's used to differentiate between collisions involving electronic device distractions and those involving other distractions.\n\n#2.  **Collision Counts by Distraction Type**:\n\n#-   **counts_electronic**: This represents the count of collisions where the driver was distracted by electronic devices.\n\n#-   **counts_other**: This represents the count of collisions where the driver was distracted by factors other than electronic devices.\n\n# **Chi-Square Test**: A chi-square test of independence is performed to assess whether there is a significant difference in collision rates between the two groups of drivers.\n# Subset the data for drivers distracted by electronic devices\n#electronic_distracted &lt;- subset(data, Driver.Distracted.By == \"ELECTRONIC DEVICE\")\n\n# Subset the data for drivers distracted by other factors\n#other_distracted &lt;- subset(data, Driver.Distracted.By != \"ELECTRONIC DEVICE\" & Driver.Distracted.By != \"NOT DISTRACTED\")\n\n# Count the number of collisions for each distraction type\n#counts_electronic &lt;- nrow(electronic_distracted)\n#counts_other &lt;- nrow(other_distracted)\n\n# Perform chi-square test\n# chi_square_test &lt;- chisq.test(c(counts_electronic, counts_other))\n\n# Print the test results\n# print(chi_square_test)\n\n#**Interpretation of Results**: The question aims to determine if drivers distracted by electronic devices have a higher collision rate compared to those distracted by other factors. To analyze this, a Chi-squared test was conducted comparing the collision counts between drivers distracted by electronic devices and those distracted by other factors. The output indicates a significant difference between the two groups, with a very low p-value (p \\&lt; 2.2e-16). This suggests that drivers distracted by electronic devices indeed have a significantly higher collision rate compared to those distracted by other factors."
