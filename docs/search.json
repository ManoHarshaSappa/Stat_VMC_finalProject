    "text": "What is Project based on?\n\nOur project revolves around a thorough examination of a dataset documenting motor vehicle collisions on county and local roadways within Montgomery County, Maryland. This dataset serves as the cornerstone for our investigation into the myriad factors that influence traffic accidents and their consequences. Through meticulous analysis and advanced statistical techniques, we aim to uncover insightful patterns and correlations that can inform proactive measures for enhancing road safety and mitigating accident risks.\nIn our endeavor, we transcend conventional data exploration by incorporating hypothesis testing and predictive modeling methodologies. By formulating and testing hypotheses pertaining to weather conditions, daylight, injury severity, vehicle types, distractions, and traffic control measures, we strive to unveil underlying relationships and trends within the data. Additionally, our predictive modeling efforts seek to anticipate injury severity and vehicle damage extent based on a diverse set of variables including collision type, vehicle movement, and speed limit. Through this comprehensive approach, our project aspires to deliver actionable insights that can empower stakeholders in making informed decisions aimed at fostering safer road environments and reducing the occurrence of motor vehicle collisions."

    "text": "What’s our Goal?\n\nOur goal is to deeply understand why and how motor vehicle collisions happen in Montgomery County, Maryland. By analyzing a vast amount of data on these accidents, we aim to uncover patterns, trends, and correlations that shed light on the factors contributing to crashes. Through this exploration, we seek to identify key variables such as weather conditions, road surfaces, vehicle types, and driver behaviors that play significant roles in accident occurrence and severity.\nUltimately, our aim is to use this knowledge to inform strategies and interventions that can enhance road safety and reduce the frequency and severity of motor vehicle collisions. By providing insights into the root causes and contributing factors of accidents, we aspire to empower policymakers, law enforcement agencies, and community stakeholders with the information they need to implement effective measures for preventing accidents and safeguarding lives on the roads of Montgomery County."

Precision, recall, and F1-score metrics provide further insight into the model’s performance for each class. However, for certain classes like “FATAL INJURY”, precision, recall, and F1-score are not defined (NaN), indicating that the model did not correctly predict any instances of that class.\nThe confusion matrix reveals the number of correct and incorrect predictions for each class. Additionally, the importance of variables in predicting injury severity is shown through MeanDecreaseGini values. In this case, “Collision.Type” has the highest importance, followed by “Weather” and “Surface.Condition”.\nOverall, the output suggests that weather conditions, road surface conditions, and collision types are significant factors in predicting the severity of injuries resulting from collisions, with “Collision.Type” being the most important predictor."

    "text": "In conclusion, the Research Design encompasses a comprehensive methodology to investigate various aspects of road safety and collision outcomes. Through a series of questions, data visualizations, hypothesis testing, and predictive modeling, the research aims to provide valuable insights into crash patterns, injury severity determinants, and predictive capabilities. The data visualizations, including crash frequency per year, geographical distribution of fatalities, and the most common vehicle makes involved in accidents, offer a clear understanding of the trends and patterns in collision occurrences. Hypothesis testing delves into the relationships between factors such as weather conditions, vehicle types, and collision rates, providing empirical evidence to support or refute the proposed hypotheses. Additionally, predictive modeling endeavors to forecast injury severity and vehicle damage extent based on various contributing factors, offering practical applications for enhancing road safety measures. Overall, the Research Design serves as a foundational framework for the subsequent analysis and interpretation of data, ultimately aiming to contribute to the development of effective strategies for accident prevention and mitigation."

    "text": "1. Visualization1: What are the trends in the frequency of car crashes over years?\n\nMethodology - To analyze the trend of crash frequency over the years, we will use ggplot2 in R. This allows us to create visual representations of data. We’ll transform the Crash_Date column into a date format and group the data by year. By visualizing this data, we can identify any noticeable patterns or trends in crash frequency over time.\n\n\n\n2. Visualization2: How does the distribution of car accidents vary geographically?\n\nMethodology - To understand the geographical distribution of car accidents, we will utilize the Leaflet package in R. This package enables us to create interactive maps displaying crash locations and associated fatalities using latitude and longitude data. By visualizing this data on a map, we can identify any geographic patterns or hotspots where accidents are more prevalent.\n\n\n\n3. Visualization3: Top 10 cars which involve in car cashes?\n\nMethodology - To identify the top 10 car manufacturers involved in car accidents, we will generate a bar plot using ggplot2 in R. This plot will showcase the most common vehicle makes involved in accidents. We’ll use dplyr for data summarization and arrangement to identify the top 10 manufacturers based on accident frequency.\n\n\n\n4. Hypothesis #1: Is there any relation between weather conditions, daylight, and injury severity?\nQuestion: - Is there any relation between weather conditions, daylight, and injury severity?\n\nMethodology - To test this hypothesis, we will conduct a Pearson’s Chi-squared test on a contingency table. This test will analyze the association between weather conditions, daylight, and injury severity. By examining the relationship between these variables statistically, we can determine if there’s a significant correlation between them.\n\n\n\n5. Hypothesis #2: Are certain types of vehicles more likely to be involved in collisions at night compared to during the day?\n\nMethodology - To investigate this hypothesis, we will perform a Pearson’s Chi-squared test comparing collision counts involving different types of vehicles during the day and at night. By statistically analyzing collision data, we can determine if certain vehicle types are more prone to accidents during specific times of the day.\n\n\n\n6. Hypothesis #3: Do drivers distracted by electronic devices have a higher rate of collisions compared to drivers distracted by other factors?\n\nMethodology - To explore this hypothesis, we will conduct a Chi-squared test comparing collision counts between drivers distracted by electronic devices and those distracted by other factors. By examining collision data and analyzing distraction-related factors, we can determine if electronic device distraction significantly impacts collision rates.\n\n\n\n7. Hypothesis #4: Can we determine the effectiveness of different traffic control measures in reducing collision rates? Which types of traffic controls are most effective in preventing collisions?\n\nMethodology - To address this hypothesis, we will conduct a Pearson’s Chi-squared test between traffic control measures and injury severity. By statistically analyzing data on traffic control measures and their impact on collision rates, we can assess the effectiveness of various measures and identify the most impactful ones for preventing collisions.\n\n\n\n8. Prediction #1: Can we predict the severity of injuries based on various factors such as weather conditions, road surface conditions, and collision type?\n\nMethodology - To make predictions about injury severity, we will utilize a random forest classification model trained on relevant dataset. This model will analyze various factors such as weather conditions, road surface conditions, and collision type to predict injury severity. By assessing the model’s accuracy and performance, we can determine its effectiveness in predicting injury severity.\n\n\n\n9. Prediction #2: Can we predict the extent of vehicle damage in collisions based on collision type, vehicle movement, and speed limit?\n\nMethodology - To make predictions about vehicle damage extent, we will evaluate model performance using confusion matrix and key predictors. By analyzing collision data and training a predictive model, we can assess its accuracy in predicting the extent of vehicle damage based on collision type, vehicle movement, and speed limit."
